                Hello! I'm Shloke, a fourth-year student at Grinnell College in Iowa, US. I previously attended DPS RK Puram, a high school in New Delhi, India, where I studied Econ, Business, Accountancy, English and Math. At Grinnell, I'm double majoring in Computer
                Science and Economics, and minoring in Statistics. I also studied abroad for one semester at Aquincum Institute of Technology in Budapest, Hungary, where I took mobile software development, theory of computation, and Hungarian language!
                <br><br> I have internship experience in both Data Science and Data Engineering, having worked for CapsicoHealth Inc. for two summers. I am proficient in several programming languages including Python, Java, C, C++, R, Kotlin and HTML/CSS
                (used to create this website). I have experience with big data, machine learning, ETL, automation, scripting and more. Click <a href="developer.html">here</a> for more details.
                <br><br> I'm currently looking for full-time Software Engineering/Data Engineering roles in the US, starting this summer.
